         This article is about me 👩‍💻. I would say: about all Moms💙. We all love our kids very much,
      and never ever want to speak out that sometimes or very often, we are
      getting so much tired and they can even make us crazy with their active
      actions 🤷‍♀‍. Being a Mother is a difficult and responsible job. We want
      to give all the best things to our kids, and strive for perfection in
      everything. But all we know that it is hard, and no matter how sad is
      for me, I have to admit that becoming a perfect Mom is impossible. Most
      of us are very far from perfection, and realization of this fact hurts
      us💔.

   As a Mom of 3 kids, I know that it is very hard to stay at the positive mood during all day, which is very important for life quality of all family members. 
 Mom's moods can have a big impact on the overall emotional environment in the home:

<br />
Every Mom has her key actions which are helping to solve everyday problems, but sometimes we need help! 
We need to hear that all problems that we are facing with are not our fault, they are usual problems that facing mostly all Moms.
And Yes, it is TRUE! <strong>-Moms!!! You are Not Alone; I am with YOU! 💚 </strong>
<br />
<br />
<hr/>
  <div class="below"> Below you can find some key methods, which are helping me to stay positive and healthy:</div>
<ul>
  <li>
    🤍Love yourself! It doesn't matter if you are fat or thin, with makeup or without it, with fashion dress or homemade one. You are special for your kids,
     be special for You as well!
  </li>
  <li>
    🤍Take care of your health, use vitamins and eat healthy food. Try to do daily 10 minutes
    <span> <a href ="https://www.healthline.com/health/fitness-exercise/10-best-exercises-everyday#start-here"> exercises </a> </span>  and  dance 💃.
    </li>
    <li>
🤍Take all above-mentioned problems easy! Enjoy your children. Remember, they have tendency to grow up and leave parents for starting their own life journey.  </li>
   <li>
 🤍Have fun every day with your kids. Play and become a kid as well, it is very interesting. <br />
 You can open
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCp7R4Og7hmqqSRFeLS0Y4Ig" target="_blank"> <span>Youtube Channel </span></a>
and make Videos all together, like we 🧸.
</li>
<li>
  🤍Choose some hobby that will force to spend time only for your interests! It will help You to stay motivated and fresh.
</li>
<li>
    🤍Don't forget about fresh air! 
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>🤍Often remind You that being a Mom is the biggest blessing ever!</strong>
    </li>
